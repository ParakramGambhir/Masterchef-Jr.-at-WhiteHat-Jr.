Step 1 - Pick up the base and cover it with pizza sauce.... To have more taste add it a bit more....
Step 2 - Pour up solid cheese bits in a large amount in order to make it cheeeeeeeeeezzzy...... u can also add ketchup instead of pizza sauce... but mixture of them won't taste better..(as per my experience..)
Step 3 - Add veggies on the cheese.... Make sure the Quantity is neither too more nor to less.....
Step 4 - Now it it ready to go in microwave....... At 180 degrees temperature, convection mode and for just 20 minutes......
Step 5 - Now take it out carefully and add chilly flakes on it(optional)...

                     NOW YOUR PIZZA IS READY TO EAT.......ATTTTAAACKKKKKKK
